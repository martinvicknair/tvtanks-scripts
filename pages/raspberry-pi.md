# My Raspberry Pi Setup

![Raspberry Pi Model B](/assets/images/rpiModelB.jpg)

I'm using an original [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Model_comparison) with 512mb of RAM.

I've installed the [Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy)](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/). Other packages include the OpenVPN server, XScreenSaver, python3, shared google drive.

- [XScreenSaver](https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/) - XScreenSaver is the standard screen saver collection shipped on most Linux and Unix systems running the X11 Window System. To install the complete suite, try:  
```sudo apt-get install xscreensaver*```

- My custom channel changer [script](https://github.com/martinvicknair/tvtanks.com/blob/main/channel_changer.py) on GitHub.
